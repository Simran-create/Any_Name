# Understanding Version Control
## Why VCS matters
- Tracks every change, so you can roll back or compare at any time. 
- Enables multiple people to work in parallel without stomping on each other.
- Maintains an audit trail for compliance and code review.
## Popular tools
- **Git:** Distributed, lightening-fast, ubiquitous
- **Mercurial / SVN:** Centralized or hybrid models
## Core Concepts
- **Repository:** your project's "database" of history.
- **Commit:** a snapshot + message.
- **Branch:** diverging lines of development.
- **Merge:** tying branches back together.
- **Remote:** a shared server (e.g. GitHub).
